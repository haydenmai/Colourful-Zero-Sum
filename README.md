# Colourful-Zero-Sum
A collaborative final project completed in CMPT 120 in Summer 2022.

## Game Description
_"You are asked to implement a Python program, allowing the user to play the “Colourful Zero Game”, possibly multiple times. This is a single player game where the goal is to make the rows and columns of a 2D game board all add to zero._

_At the end of each game, your program will display text based and save image based results and invite the user to play 
again. When the user is done playing, information about all games is shown."_

## Concepts Used
- Reading CSV files
- Text interaction with user
- Manipulating up to three dimensional lists
- Single & nested loops, accumation patterns
- Manipulating RGB pixels images
- Using dictionaries & modular functions
